# CNN-Based-Neural-Network-for-Sign-Language-Interpretation
Machine Learning Model trained to classify Sign Language Hand Gestures.

<h2> THE GOAL </h2>
The goal of the project is to train a model to be able to classify Hand gestured American Sign Language and translate them to its corresponding English letter.

<h2> Dataset </h2>
The Dataset was acquired from the Kaggle website ()

<h2> The Results </h2>
The model was trained using the GPU in the Google Colab Platform. The model architecture is clear in the <strong><em>model.py</em></strong> file, and the training parameters in the <strong><em>train.py</em></strong> file. The overall accuracy of the model on unseen data is 95%.
